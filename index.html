<ul> 
	<li>[Verse 1: SZA ]<br>
	<br>
	I'll touch that fire for you
	I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
	I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
	I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
	Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
	Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
	Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
	<span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">I don't got nobody, just with you right now
	Tell the truth, I look better under you.
	</span> 
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	[Chorus: SZA & Justin Bieber ]<br>
	<br>
	<span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">I can't lose when I'm with you</span>
	How can I snooze and miss the moment?
	You just too important
	Nobody do body like you do
	I can't lose when I'm with you
	I can't just snooze and miss the moment
	You just too important
	Nobody do body like you do, you do</li>
	<br>
	<li>[Verse 2: SZA & Justin Bieber ]<br>
	<br>
	In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface) 
	Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (Your main one)
	Lеt's take this argument back up to my place (My placе)
	Sex remind you I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one (Day one)
	We ain't have shit yet, it was magic, yeah
	Smash and grab shit, yeah
	Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
	<span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">Ain't a home when you not here</span>
	Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'
